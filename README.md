## Layout

**tl;dr - pretty standard 65% layout WKL bottom row and split backspace**

This keyboard is a 65% board. Which means it's basically a 60% layout that's been extended by 1 column which allows us to comfortably incorporate an arrow cluster and a couple of the useful navigation keys. It's a fixed layout because it's being built just for me as a personal project. So don't expect any allowances in plate or case design for other layouts.

It's using a HHKB style layout (ANSI base with split backspace, Esc next to the 1), a Winkeyless style bottom row with a 7u spacebar, and a 1u logo blocker in the top right (because aesthetics). The right shift has been shrunk to 1.75u to allow for the up arrow. It looks like this:
